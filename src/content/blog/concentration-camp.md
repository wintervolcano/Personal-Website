It was the best eve of the year. The shady maroon was almost finding its battle lost to the shallow blue. It was too windy on the height of the aluminum sheets. This was his only refuge for almost a year. Now he could perceive it, the taste of the wind, the smell of the colors and the grip on his feet. Out of the multitudinous memoryless times, he’d been on these sheets, this time seemed like freedom. He was ultimately leaving these walls.

He was one of the millions of games who sacrificed their one whole year full of incidents, happiness, loneliness or anything that included in life’s package, in search of a safe future.which after a year of toil and drudgery felt like the most precarious place to be. He never scored that place as life. It was death, the death of everything one would designate the colors of life.

The avid reader in him was dying in the midst of books that they call as the ultimate collection of knowledge. Out of the rare solitude, he got to look back and cry, these aluminum sheets were the only place that saw him smile. But still, he never noticed the vast river. Its extensive beauty during sunsets and sunrises or the constant pool of happy wings that always flew north.

Even though he chose this place to be his home for a year of preparation, he never thought that this immense intolerable inexplainable pain was what it had in store.

He wanted to be a scientist and failed to get enrolled at a place where he would become one. Like all others who failed, he recalled the story of the greatest man in history who lost more wars than he won but still was called Great. Like everyone else he got ‘enrolled’; to try again. Where his umbilical with the outer world was torn. He tried his best to make head and tail of all the information that his tutors emptied on him. Every head and eye that he slept with under the roof was to be the one who would occupy that one space he had in his good future.

When everything was going chaos the only thing he could do was watch. In his far-off future, this one year might be nothing but a blink. ‘Time’ can take different forms.It will be your smile upon past,hope towards future. But in the present it is Death. When you live through it, there is nothing difficult than living. But later when you move out of it, neither would there be anything better.

Unlike those free, careless years he lived through, this year at this coaching center was limbo for his free wings. Whenever the pressure became disturbing on him, more than often, he found comfort on these sheets above the terrace. where no one bothers to come. Her voice through the mobile phone he snuck in, was his only hope.

> She would talk an everlasting words  
>  
> dedicating them all to him  
>  
> and he would give her all his love  
>  
> here if she should call to him.  
>  
> Because words were all he had.

He would look at the endless bridge that connects across the river, it was always lit with vehicle lights, still, he never got to trudge it. In this place, he never felt the grip on his feet. ‘Everything’ seemed to slip away under them.

> “The sky usually was like spillage- cold, heavy, slippery, and gray-but once in a while, some stars had the nerves to rise and float, if only for a few minutes. On those nights he stays a little longer..”

Yes, he had a dream but he couldn’t convince himself to deprive him of everything that he enjoyed for that. He never found any harm in reading a newspaper or playing for an hour a day. His legs were becoming weak and his talkative mouth was bound with the thread of accusing eyes. He saw his shadow cry. But still, he dived deeper into that pit and he never knew why.

The last thing he remembers is the fight that he had with everyone. It was particularly different from every other fight. He was furious. He was out of control; to get control of his life. Everything inside him saw an eruption. And with that, he became free. He was out of that place. He felt the sand under his feet after a long time. He saw the bright moon shining above with a million stars singing the chorus.

Like the river that always reached its destination, the birds that always found north, the twilight which always gave way to the starry nights. He will undoubtedly have a place for him at his destination. But sometimes, destinations may not make you content, you might want to go off through the stray to feel the blossom of life.

She never called after the concentration camp…
