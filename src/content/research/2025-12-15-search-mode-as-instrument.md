I like interfaces that teach the user **how to think**, not just what to click.

This site’s Search Mode is a toy model of a real workflow:

- watch the time series,
- inspect the Fourier domain,
- lock a candidate,
- confirm or reject,
- write down what you learned.

Next: attach real fold plots and metadata to each target.
