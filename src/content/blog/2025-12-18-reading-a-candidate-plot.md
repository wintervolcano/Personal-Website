When I'm skimming candidates, I try to answer three questions quickly:

1) **Is it astrophysical-looking across frequency?**  
If the signal has a sensible DM sweep (or behaves consistently across subbands), it's worth a second look.

2) **Does the period look stable?**  
Harmonics and sub-harmonics can fool you. I check if the folded profile sharpens at integer multiples.

3) **Is there an RFI smell?**  
Perfectly repeating patterns, narrowband streaks, or the same signature at many DMs = caution.

If a candidate survives those checks, *then* I take my time.
